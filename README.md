# Notes_onDataFemi

This is my personel notes on the book Data Feminism. 

I will upload my chinese version translation (only some key concepts of the chapter), and update some notes after the discussion in our reading group. 

Thanks for my supervisor who organize the reading. 

You can refer to our schedule here in the [website](https://sites.google.com/ids.osaka-u.ac.jp/ethics-reading-group).
